## Style: clean up style.css and ensure only CSS is present (81d2432)

Refactored CSS structure and removed non-CSS content from stylesheets

Streamlined CSS files by removing inline styles, redundant rules, and non-CSS content to ensure they contain only valid CSS definitions.

### Changes

- Removed inline JavaScript and HTML snippets from `style.css` and `styles.css` files.
- Consolidated redundant and unused CSS rules, focusing on animation, layout, and component styling.
- Deleted unnecessary files (`styles.css`) and reorganized styling components into relevant sections.

### Impact

- Improves maintainability and readability of CSS files by adhering to proper content separation.
- No functional behavioral changes observed, as the refactor targets formatting and structure.
- Potential dependency on JavaScript-based DOM updates for dynamic styles (e.g., animations, health bars).
- No breaking changes expected, but test UI elements for appearance consistency.
