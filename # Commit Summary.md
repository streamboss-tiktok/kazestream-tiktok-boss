Impact
ðŸ”¹ Leaderboard improvementsâ€”top attacker dynamically highlighted. ðŸ”¹ Enhanced visualsâ€”larger boss sprite and clearer text styling. ðŸ”¹ Streamlined logicâ€”better maintainability and code clarity. ðŸ”¹ Dependency remains on JavaScript for leaderboard updates and DOM changes. ðŸ”¹ No breaking changes detected, but UI consistency should be tested across browsers.
