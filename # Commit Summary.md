## Finalize overlay: boss logic, chat, leaderboard, visuals (eaabb73)

Finalize overlay logic and improve visuals

Refactored boss overlay logic, enhanced leaderboard functionality, and adjusted visuals for improved user experience while ensuring code maintainability.

### Changes

- Consolidated and cleaned up `style.css`, removing unused rules and non-CSS content.
- Updated `main.js` to improve boss logic, leaderboard updates, and visual adjustments:
  - Increased boss sprite size (`256px`).
  - Added support for displaying the top attacker dynamically.
  - Simplified `getDisplayName` and refactored several function calls for clarity.
- Streamlined `index.html` structure by reordering and clarifying element placement.
- Removed inline styles in chat logic and moved focus to external stylesheets.

### Impact

- Behavioral improvements in leaderboard updates and highlighting the top attacker.
- Enhanced visuals with larger boss sprites and better text styling for the top attacker.
- Dependency on JavaScript for dynamic leaderboard and DOM updates remains.
- No breaking changes noted, but UI consistency should be tested across browsers.
