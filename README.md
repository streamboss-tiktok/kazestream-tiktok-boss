KazeStream TikTok Boss Overlay 🎮
A dynamic interactive overlay for TikTok Live streams, where viewers engage with a "Boss" by sending coins, likes, and shares!

🚀 Setup Instructions

⚙️ Streamer.bot Setup
1. Install TikTok-Live-Connector
Download and run TikTok-Live-Connector.

2. Create WebSocket Action
In Streamer.bot, add a new Action.

Configure it to Send to Stream Boss.

3. WebSocket Trigger Setup
Trigger Type: WebSocket Client Message

Activate it when TikTok events are received.

4. Send Event Data to WebSocket
Use the following JSON format:
