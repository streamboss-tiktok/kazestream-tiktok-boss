Node Binary Package
This package installs a Node.js binary into your project. Since npm runs scripts with the local ./node_modules/.bin directory in the PATH ahead of the system copy, you can have a local version of Node that differs from your system-installed version. In this way, Node can be managed as a normal dependency.

> Warning: > Do not install this globally with npm 2. > npm@2 immediately removes Node, which prevents the scripts that make this work from running.

Usage
Install via npm
To install the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Node as a dependency in your project, run:

sh
npm i node@lts
Running Scripts with npx
You can run your scripts using the locally installed Node with npx:

sh
npx node@4 myscript.js
This command runs myscript.js with the latest Node version from the v4 major series.

Shell Auto-Fallback
Thanks to the shell auto-fallback feature of npx, you can even run your script like so:

sh
node@4 myscript.js
Credits
Major thanks to Kat Marchán for late-night problem solving, and to CJ Silverio and Maciej Małecki for inspiring the idea to package Node in this way. It turns out that if you ask "why not?!" once in a while, something fun happens.

This README should help users understand how to install and use the local Node binary in their projects. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
